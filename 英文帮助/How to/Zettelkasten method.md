If you've been using the Zettelkasten method to structure your notes, here's something you might want to know:

Links in Obsidian require a full match to the note name. This means that `[[202001010000]]` will not properly link to `[[202001010000 My Note]]`.

In order to fix that, you can use our [[markdown format converter]] to convert your Zettelkasten links into either `[[202001010000 My Note]]` or `[[202001010000 My Note|My Note]]`.
